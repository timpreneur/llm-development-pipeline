# pipeline-ship — close checklist

Run this before surfacing to Timm. No shortcuts. This is touchpoint #4.

## Checklist

1. Every H2 in `references/ship-template.md` is present and non-empty in `04-ship.md`. Empty sections must be `N/A — <reason>`, not omitted.
2. Frontmatter complete:
   - `session: 04-ship`
   - `feature_id`, `project`, `owner: timm`
   - `status: ready-for-signoff` (NOT `shipped` — Timm flips that)
   - `inputs: [00-manifest.md, 01-brief.md, 02-plan.md, 03-build-notes.md]`
   - `regulated`, `customer_facing_launch` copied from brief (must be literal `true` / `false`)
   - `deploy_url` set
   - `deploy_state: READY`
   - `agentic_qa_coverage_pct` set (integer 0–100)
   - `punchlist_blocking_open` set (integer ≥ 0)
   - `punchlist_url` set (feature-scoped web app URL)
   - `watch_window_task_id` set
3. Deploy state is `READY` via the platform MCP — not just "pushed to main". The verification call + response snippet is in the `## Deploy` section.
4. Production smoke has both a read and a write path recorded, with timestamps. Evidence, not "LGTM".
5. Agentic QA: `## Agentic QA` section present with `checks_run`, AC coverage table (every brief AC accounted for), findings table (or `None — agentic pass produced no findings.`), autonomous coverage %. Any open `blocking` finding = STOP, surface to Timm (Phase 3 should have paused — contract break if you got here).
6. Punchlist: `04-punchlist.json` exists, passes `check-punchlist.sh` (no RED), schema_version is `"2"`. `## Punchlist` section in `04-ship.md` records the web app URL, blocking/watch counts, schema check result, and gating mode.
7. Observability: critical path listed, correlation ID field named, named metrics with dimensions, ≥1 alert with a named route, dashboard URL recorded.
8. Watch window: `task_id` returned from `schedule` skill, `cohort_id`, `opens_at`, `closes_at` all recorded. No task_id = stop, surface to Timm.
9. Rollback plan present with trigger, steps, ETA, owner. Not aspirational — actual commands / MCP calls.
10. Release notes: internal draft present. Customer-facing draft present per brief's `customer_facing_launch` flag (manually authored in v0.1.0 if Build's Marketing wrapper is deferred, and noted as such).
11. Promotion: all three fields addressed — `repo_brief_dir` (action or `N/A — not declared`), `changelog_path` (action or `N/A — not declared`), **punchlist mirror + V1 pointer always written** (not optional).
12. Manifest updated: `04-ship: ready-for-signoff`, deploy URL, dashboard URL, watch-window task_id, punchlist URL recorded.
13. `bash scripts/check-ship.sh <FEATURE_DIR>/04-ship.md` — no RED.
14. **Sign-off gating check.** Consult `pipeline.punchlist_gating` in `<PROJECT>/CLAUDE.md` (default `strict`):
    - `strict` → any `items[].severity: blocking` open blocks sign-off. Do NOT surface the close message; instead, surface the blocker list and ask Timm to address them (or override).
    - `advisory` → surface the count in the close message but proceed. Log the override + reason to `lessons.md` on close.

Reply "signed off" to flip manifest + 04-ship.md to `shipped`.
Reply with changes and I'll cycle before closing.

[if regulated=true: append] ⚠ Regulated surface — preserved escalation text in build-notes; no Legal wrapper in v0.1.0.
[if customer_facing_launch=true and manual draft: append] ⚠ Customer-facing copy authored manually in v0.1.0 (Build Marketing wrapper deferred). Read the customer-facing note before signing off.
[if punchlist_blocking_open>0 AND gating=advisory: append] ⚠ <N> open blocking punchlist items — gating override is `advisory`. Reason: <reason from CLAUDE.md or lessons.md>. Review before signing.
```

## Post-sign-off (after Timm replies "signed off" / "approved")

1. Flip `04-ship: shipped` in `00-manifest.md`.
2. Flip `status: shipped` in `04-ship.md` frontmatter.
3. If any notable pattern surfaced during this ship (deploy-state check failure, dashboard gap, release-note thrash, etc.), append to `lessons.md` with phase tag.

## Post-sign-off (after Timm replies with changes)

Cycle. Address changes, re-run `check-ship.sh`, re-surface with the updated verbatim message. Do not flip `shipped` until explicit sign-off.
